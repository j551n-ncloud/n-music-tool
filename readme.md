## üöÄ Installation

### Option 1: Quick Installation Script (Recommended for Local Use)

The easiest way to get started with N-Music Tool:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/j551n-ncloud/n-music-tool.git
   cd n-music-tool
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

This script will:
- Install all prerequisites if needed (Python, pip, venv, ffmpeg)
- Create a Python virtual environment with required dependencies
- Set up your music directory configuration
- Create convenient launcher scripts

### Option 2: Create a Standalone Binary

If you want a standalone binary that can be used without Python dependencies:

1. After running the installation script, run:
   ```bash
   ./build-binary.sh
   ```

2. This will create a standalone binary in the `bin` directory
3. Optionally install it system-wide (the script will prompt you)

### Option 3: Using Docker

For containerized usage with all dependencies pre-installed:

1. Build and run using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   docker-compose exec n-music bash
   ```

2. Or use Docker directly with a custom music directory:
   ```bash
   docker build -t n-music-tool .
   docker run -it -v "/path/to/your/music:/music" -e BASE_PATH=/music n-music-tool
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can change your music directory at any time:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will create a configuration file at `~/.config/n-music/config` that stores your base music directory.music-tool.git
   cd n-music-tool
   ```

2. Build and run using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   docker-compose exec n-music bash /app/n-music.sh
   ```

   Or using Docker directly:
   ```bash
   docker build -t n-music-tool .
   docker run -it -v "$(pwd)/music:/music" n-music-tool
   ```

## üìñ Usage

Run the script by executing:

```bash
./n-music.sh
```

### Interactive Menu Options

The script provides an interactive menu with the following options:

1. **Run ALL** - Download music, generate playlist, and embed lyrics in one go
2. **Only download music** - Download tracks from a Spotify playlist URL
3. **Only generate .m3u playlist** - Create a playlist from existing MP3 files
4. **Only embed lyrics into MP3s** - Embed .lrc lyrics into your MP3 files
5. **Exit** - Exit the script

For each operation, you'll be prompted to select or enter a directory where the files are stored or where you want them to be saved.

### Directory Selection

When prompted, you can either:
- Select an existing directory from the numbered list
- Choose "Enter a custom directory" to input a custom path

If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

## üìù Examples

1. Choose option 2 from the main menu
2. Select or enter a directory for the downloads
3. Paste your Spotify playlist URL when prompted
4. The script will download all tracks and generate lyric files

### Creating a Playlist

1. Choose option 3 from the main menu
2. Select the directory containing your MP3 files
3. Enter a name for your playlist
4. A .m3u file will be created with all MP3 files in the directory

### Embedding Lyrics

1. Choose option 4 from the main menu
2. Select the directory containing your MP3 files and corresponding .lrc files
3. The script will embed lyrics from each .lrc file into its corresponding MP3 file
